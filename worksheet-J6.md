### Question 1
The output was the same every time I compiled and ran the files, except for the first time I did it.

Here is the memory diagram at `//MARK`:

### Question 2 
After adding the sleep statement, the output seems to actually reflect parallel processes-- the print statments alternate (for the most part).

The thread that finishes first changes-- it tends to be the "Good afternoon!" thread (surprisingly, since it starts after than the "Good morning!" thread), but sometimes it's the "Good morning!" thread.
